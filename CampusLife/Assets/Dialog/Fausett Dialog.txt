So here is Fausett. I think this is where the Language departments are located.*I went there once for this literature workshop. It was pretty fun.*We made poems with pages from a book. Just tore a page out and drew on it.*I kind of want to go to another one, but I got to give a tour.*...And they haven't announced one yet.* Anyway.
