So here we have Ellis hall.*It has an auditorium, which is really cool. I don't know if it is the biggest on campus, but still good enough for a wind ensemble.*Oh! I can't forget to talk about the fountain.*Yeah, see the fountain in front of Ellis hall?*Well, it is tradition to toss a student into the fountain on their birthday.*Of course, I haven't been thrown in and please don't throw me in.*I don't like getting wet.
