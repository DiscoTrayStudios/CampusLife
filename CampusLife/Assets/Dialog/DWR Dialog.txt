Here we come to the D.W. Reynolds Life Science building. I think the biology department is located here.*Fun story, there is an elephant skeleton on display here.*Yeah, a former professor worked with students to exhume this skeleton.*And now it went on display as part of an Odyssey project.*Cool, right?
